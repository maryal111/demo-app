###### I used Angular Material Library for the Tables and Pagination. Angular Material makes it easier to display the data in table and paginate.

###### I've added minimal error handeling to the application when I was coding, I would've added a bit more error handeling depending on the types of error response from the api. I've also have added a loading spinner when the page was loading instead of a text since the api response can take some time. 

###### I haven't had a chance to work with the server side pagination at work. I've deal mostly with the client side pagination. I really had fun and it was refreshing to fetch the data from the backend api while paginating. 

###### I spent most of the time figuring out the query parameters to call the endpoint. I found that a bit confusing and I'm not sure if got it right.
